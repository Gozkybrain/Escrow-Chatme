## Admin Perspective
The authentication of the app is simple, the App entry has a switch cse for two primary components; `GetUser.jsx` and `GetAuth.jsx`. If the user is authenticated, the `GetUser.jsx` comes to play with all of its routes, else the later comes in respectively. Thereby making the App totally authenticated all round.

## Escrow Logic

The escrow system ensures secure transactions with the following logic:

1. **HandleSubmit** (`CreateEscrow.jsx`): This function initiates the escrow by deducting the specified amount from the initiator‚Äôs balance and creating an escrow record in the database.

2. **HandleCancel** (`EscrowDetails.jsx`): This function refunds the escrow amount to the initiator‚Äôs balance if the escrow is canceled. It updates the escrow status to 'canceled' and restores the funds to the initiator.

3. **HandleAccept** (`EscrowDetails.jxs`): This function allows the recipient to accept the escrow, marking it as 'accepted'. It notifies both parties and waits for confirmation from the initiator before the funds are released.

4. **HandleConfirm** (`EscrowDetails.js`): This function confirms the completion of the escrow. Once confirmed by the initiator, it finalizes the transaction by marking it as 'completed' and transfers the funds to the recipient‚Äôs balance.

These functions handle the escrow process, managing funds and status updates securely.
